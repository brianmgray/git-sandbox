     Ferris, Sloane and Cameron are standing in the restaurant.
     Ferris is looking at the maitre 'd's reservations book.

     INT. RESTAURANT

     The maitre'd returns.

                              MAITRE'D
                          (to Ferris)
               May I help you?

                              FERRIS
               Yes. I'm Abe Frohman. Party of
               three for 12:00.

     The maitre'd looks at Ferris curiously.

                              FERRIS
               Is there a problem?

                              MAITRE'D
               You're Abe Frohman?

                              FERRIS
               I'm Abe Frohman.

                              MAITRE'D
                          (chuckles)
               I'm sorry, son. I'm very busy right
               now. If you have trouble finding the
               door...

     Sloane tugs Ferris' sleeve. He ignores her.

                              FERRIS
               Are you suggesting that I'm not
               who I say I am?

                              MAITRE'D
               Shall I call the police?

                              CAMERON
               Let's go...Abe.

                              FERRIS
               I'm not going anywhere.
                          (to the Maitre'd)
               Call the police. Go ahead. Better
               yet...
                          (grabs the phone)
               ...I'll call myself.

     Cameron chokes. Sloane grits her teeth. The maitre'd smiles
     smuggly.

     CU. PHONE

     Ferris punches out a number. A beat and the restaurant's
     second line lights up and the phone rings.

     INT. RESTAURANT

     The maitre'd motions for the phone so that he can answer the
     call. Ferris waves him off angrily.

                              FERRIS
               You touch me and I yell "rat!"
               There's another phone around here.
               Find it.

     The maitre'd backs off.

                              CAMERON
               Ferris, let's split, please?

                              SLOANE
               Cameron's right. We're gonna
               get busted.

                              FERRIS
               Not a chance in the world.

     He hands the phone to Sloane.

                              FERRIS
               Ask for Abe Frohman.
