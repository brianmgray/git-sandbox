                  (pulling his sword)
             Thank you.

                         INIGO
             We'll wait until you're ready.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Again. Thank you.

The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held
the rope. He tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see
several large rocks tumble out. The Man In Black wears
gloves. Inigo stares at them.

                         INIGO
             I do not mean to pry, but you
             don't by any chance happen to
             have eight fingers on your left
             hand?

He glances up -- the question clearly baffles him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Do you always begin conversations
             this way?

                         INIGO
             My father was slaughtered by a
             sixfingered man. He was a great
             swordmaker, my father. And when
             the six-fingered man appeared and
             requested a special sword, my
             father took the job. He slaved a
             year before he was done.

He hands his sword to the Man In Black.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fondling it-impressed)
             I have never seen its equal.

CLOSE UP - INIGO

Even now, this still brings pain.

                         INIGO
             The six-fingered man returned and
             demanded it, but at one-tenth his
             promised price. My father refused.
             Without a word, the six-fingered
             man slashed him through the heart.
             I loved my father, so, naturally,
             challenged his murderer to a duel
             ... I failed ...

                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             the six-fingered man did leave me
             alive with the six-fingered
             sword, but he gave me these.

He touches his scars.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

looking up at Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             How old were you?

                         INIGO
             I was eleven years old. When I
             was strong enough, I dedicated my
             life to the study of fencing. So
             the next time we meet, I will not
             fail. I will go up to the
             sixfingered man and say, "Hello,
             my name is Inigo Montoya. You
             killed my father. Prepare to die."

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You've done nothing but study
             swordplay?

                         INIGO
             More pursuit than study lately.
             You see, I cannot find him. It's
             been twenty years now. I am
             starting to lose confidence. I
             just work for Vizzini to pay the
             bills. There's not a lot of money
             in revenge.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (handing back the
                  great sword, starting
                  to rise)
             Well, I certainly hope you find
             him, someday.

                         INIGO
             You are ready, then?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Whether I am or not, you've been
             more than fair.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.


                         INIGO
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (walking away a few
                  paces, unsheathing his sword)
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to die.

                         INIGO
             Begin!

And on that word --

THE TWO OF THEM

And what we are starting now is one of the two greatest
sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later
on), and right from the beginning it looks different.

Because they aren't close to each other -- none of the
swordscrossing "en garde" garbage.

No, what we have here is two men, two athletes, and they
look to be too faraway to damage each other, but each time
one makes even the tiniest feint, the other counters, and
there is silence, and as they start to circle --
